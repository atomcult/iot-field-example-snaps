# IoT Field example snaps

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of snaps created by the Devices Field
team. These snaps are proof-of-concept style examples and should be referred to
only as a reference for accomplishing a particular task.

Each subdirectory is a single snap, each with their own accompanying READMEs
which explain what they do, how they function, build instructions, and potential
limitations or ways to extend behavior.
